<p>I'm a PhD candidate in Economic and Finance at the University of St. Gallen. 
My research interests focus on applied financial econometrics and the use of new 
data sources to improve existing models. In more detail, my current research 
projects analyze the influence and predictive power of retail investors' behavior 
for the distribution of stock prices. In particular, using online social media 
data and textual analysis tools, I investigates the impact of noise trading on 
the conditional mean and variance of stock returns. 
In my spare time, I like to go climbing, hiking, and in the winter sking. </p>
