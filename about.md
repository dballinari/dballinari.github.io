<p>I'm a Postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University
of Basel. I obtained my PhD in Economics and Finance from the University of St. Gallen in 
2020. My research interests focus on applied financial econometrics and new data 
sources to improve existing models. In my current projects, I analyze 
the influence and predictive power of retail investors' behavior for the 
distribution of stock prices in more detail. In particular, using online social 
media data and textual analysis tools, I investigate the impact of noise trading 
on the conditional mean and variance of stock returns. In my spare time, I like to
go climbing, hiking, and in the winter skiing. </p>
